# responsive-columns

_[Demo and API Docs](https://juravenator.github.io/responsive-columns/)_

`responsive-columns` displays its content in a column layout, or a series of
animated pages, depending on the available size.

It is made using Polymer 1.x. It uses
[app-toolbar](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/app-layout?active=app-toolbar) and [neon-animated-pages](https://elements.polymer-project.org/elements/neon-animation?active=neon-animated-pages).

Apart from the toolbar used for the animated pages, this element makes no
assumptions about the used design pattern (i.e. the styling of the columns is up
to you).
